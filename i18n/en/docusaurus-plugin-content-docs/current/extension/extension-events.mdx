# Receiving events from the extension

The CapMonster extension allows your code to track key moments in the captcha solving process directly on the webpage. Using events, you can know when a captcha solving attempt starts, when it successfully completes, or if an error occurs, and perform the corresponding actions in your script.

All events are sent to the global `window` object on the current page. This means you can subscribe to them using the standard `window.addEventListener` method and respond to events without complex workarounds.

Using these events is convenient if you want to:

* Track the progress of captcha solving in real time.
* Automatically trigger actions after a captcha is successfully solved.
* Handle errors and re-initiate captcha solving if necessary.

The following sections provide a complete list of available events with a brief description of each.
