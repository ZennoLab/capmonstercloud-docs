Our service can only solve captchas in English; on this site, the determination of the captcha language comes not from the system settings, but from the language selected on the site, so for a correct solution, be sure to select English.

        <summary>Error 'Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'click')'</summary>

"If you encounter the error 'Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'click')' while solving a captcha using the click method (ComplexImageTask) through the CapMonster Cloud extension, as shown in the screenshot, it is recommended to set the 'Delay between click' value in the extension â€” this may help resolve the issue."
