# Integrating the extension into Selenium using Node.js

In this guide, we will take a detailed look at how to connect a browser extension to Selenium WebDriver using Node.js and use it to perform automated actions on websites.

## Step 1: Installation

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node.js Package Manager) on your computer. You can download it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) Node.js.

2. Install the required packages using npm:

```bash
npm install selenium-webdriver
```
## Step 2: Changing extension parameters

Before you start automation with the extension, you need to add initial settings. You should add `clientKey` to the `defaultSettings.json` file.

To do this, you need to download the [extension archive](extension-main.md).

Unpack the extension and and in the root of the unpacked archive there will be a `defaultSettings.json` file where you can change the settings. [Here](ext-settings.md) you can find a description of the parameters.

After the settings have been successfully changed, you need to archive it back into a .zip file.

## Step 3: Setting Selenium WebDriver to work with the extensionâ€‹

Now configure Selenium WebDriver to use the created browser profile.

To do this, create an `index.js` file with the following content:

```js
const { Builder, By, Key, until } = require('selenium-webdriver');
const chrome = require('selenium-webdriver/chrome');
const path = require('path');

(async function example() {
  // Path to the extension .zip file
  const extensionPath = path.resolve(__dirname, './extension.zip');

  // Creating a browser options object
  const options = new chrome.Options();
  
  // Adding the extension to browser options
  options.addExtensions(extensionPath);

  // Creating a web driver instance
  const driver = new Builder()
    .forBrowser('chrome')
    .setChromeOptions(options)
    .build();

  try {
    // Open Google page
    await driver.get('https://google.com/');
    
    // Example: find an element on the page and interacting with it
    const searchBox = await driver.findElement(By.name('q'));
    await searchBox.sendKeys('Selenium with extension', Key.RETURN);
    
    // Wait for search results
    await driver.wait(until.titleContains('Selenium with extension'), 5000);
  } finally {
    // Close the browser 
    await driver.quit();
  }
})();
```

## Step 4: Writing automated actions
Now when the browser extension is configured, you can use WebDriver methods to perform automated actions on your website.

Example of an automated action:

```js
// If you want to click on an element on the page
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[@id='my-button']")).click();
```

## Step 5: Running the script

To run our automatic script, which will launch the browser and perform the actions mentioned above, you need to write in the console:

```bash
node index.js
```

To update the extension without data loss, you need to copy all settings and data from the old version, download the new version of the extension, unzip it and replace the old version with the new one.
