</details>

## Connecting to other programs in 3 steps
1. In your program, select one of the captcha solvers that we support:
   `Anti-Captcha (v1.0, v2.0), RuCaptcha, RipCaptcha, 2Captcha, BypassCaptcha, DeathByCaptcha`.
1. Then specify your personal API key for CapMonsterCloud in the relevant field in your program from which you will send captchas.
   1. **note for DeathByCaptcha:** to identify a user, DeathByCaptcha API employs a username and password, not an API key. In this case, specify the API key for CapMonsterCloud in the password field. Enter any value in the username field.
1. Last step: match our IP with another service so CapMonster Cloud can get captchas from the aforementioned services. For that, select your operating system, hit the spoiler, and follow the instruction.
