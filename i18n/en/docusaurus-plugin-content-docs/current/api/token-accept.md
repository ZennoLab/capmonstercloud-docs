## What to do if a site is only accepting a portion of tokens from CapMonster Cloud?

## Description

Sometimes a website may reject tokens obtained from CapMonster Cloud. This can happen in different ways: the site may accept only some of the tokens or accept them inconsistently. In such cases, using the `nocache` parameter can help, as it prevents the reuse of old tokens and increases the likelihood that the tokens will be successfully accepted by the site.

## How to pass a parameter?

### Via API key

:::caution
Will be applied to all sent captchas.
:::

You can apply `nocache` to all submitted captchas by appending it to the end of your API key using a double underscore:

`API_KEY__nocache`

### When requesting createTask

:::tip
Notice the *nocache* property of the *task* object
:::

```json
{
  "clientKey":"API_KEY",

  "task": 
  {
    "type":"RecaptchaV2Task",
    "websiteURL":"https://lessons.zennolab.com/captchas/recaptcha/v2_simple.php?level=high",
    "websiteKey":"6Lcg7CMUAAAAANphynKgn9YAgA4tQ2KI_iqRyTwd",
    "nocache": true

  }
}
```

### When creating a task via the API (using URL parameters)

Add `nocache=1` directly to the API request URL:

:::tip
The `nocache` parameter should be added at the very end of the URL.
:::

`http://api.capmonster.cloud/in.php?key=API_KEY&method=userrecaptcha&googlekey=6Lcg7CMUAAAAANphynKgn9YAgA4tQ2KI_iqRyTwd&pageurl=https://lessons.zennolab.com/captchas/recaptcha/v2_simple.php?level=high&nocache=1`
